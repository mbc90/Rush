* Rush!
Rush stands for Rust Shell
it is a very basic shell I wrote to get a little familiar with rust
** Builtin
*** cd
just a basic plain-old cd to change directories whenever you fell like it, hopefully with some helpful error messages. 
*** pwd
will display the current dir.
*** hostname
display the hostname, the crate i used says it will work on windows, but I never checked due to not wanting to boot up windows.
*** mkdir
just calling mkdir will make a directory but will not create the parents.
it will accept the flag *-p* to make the parent directories.
#+begin_src sh
  # normal mkdir
  mkdir foo
  # make parents
  mkdir -p foo/bar
#+end_src
*** exit
it exits, that is it.
** everything else!
will spawn a process and execute whatever program you call.
